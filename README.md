Xiao Wang needs to award his team members points <br>

100 points are split among himself and the members of his group <br>

These points are used to calculate a 'PAF' and a 'SAPA' <br>

PAF stands for Peer Assessment Factor<br>

SAPA stands for Self Assessment over Peer Assessment<br>

SAPA gives an indication of how realistically students judge their individual contribution to a group project<br>

The calculation and interpretation of PAF and SAPA is explained here:

			</td>
			<td><strong>Alarm! Team failure</strong></td>
			<td>Something has gone wrong – either there is a student who is not participating at all or this student has taken all the work home and done it by themselves. Either way, learning objectives are probably not being achieved.</td>
		</tr><tr><td>1.15 - 1.5</td>
			<td><strong>Super Leader</strong></td>
			<td>The team balance probably needs to be addressed as to achieve such a high score other students must not be participating or this student is doing far too much.</td>
		</tr><tr><td>1.05 - 1.15</td>
			<td>
				<p><strong>Leader </strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>The student is showing definite leadership qualities and/or has been putting in significant extra effort.</td>
		</tr><tr><td>1.00 - 1.05</td>
			<td><strong>Good teamwork</strong></td>
			<td>The student is working well with the group and has been recognised as pulling their weight (1.00) and perhaps a little more (&gt;1.00).</td>
		</tr><tr><td>0.95 - 1.00</td>
			<td><strong>Acceptable teamwork</strong></td>
			<td>
				<p>This student has probably only been penalised because another team member has shown leadership and put in extra effort.</p>
			</td>
		</tr><tr><td>0.85 - 0.95</td>
			<td><strong>Social Loafer</strong></td>
			<td>Any PAF below 0.95 is unacceptable. Social loafers who lie in this band can usually be mentored with the group’s help and become productive members of the group.</td>
		</tr><tr><td>0.75 - 0.85</td>
			<td><strong>Super Social Loafer</strong></td>
			<td>As above and below.</td>
		</tr><tr><td>&lt; 0.75</td>
			<td><strong>Alarm! Individual failure!</strong></td>
			<td>The individual is in grave danger of failing the course. Much work is required for this student to be accepted back into the group and there will be trust issues with allocating this student any work.</td>
